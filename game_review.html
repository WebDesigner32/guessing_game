<h2>Raymond Murray</h2>
<p>Probably the single greatest game known to man. </br> I say this because I am a number theorist and I </br>have a lot of time to kill.</p>

<h2>Michael Duff</h2>
<p>I like the game, but I do not have time to guess </br> large numbers when I work full time as an </br>airline pilot. My kids get upset everytime I tell </br>them I can't play. I should probably seek therapy.</p>
